# jetkvm_control

**jetkvm_control** is a Rust library and client for interacting with JetKVM devices using WebRTC and JSONâ€‘RPC. It provides functionality to authenticate with a JetKVM server, set up a WebRTC PeerConnection with a DataChannel, and send various input events (keyboard and mouse) as well as receive notifications (such as screen resolution updates) from the device.

## Features

- **HTTP Authentication:** Log in to a JetKVM server with cookie-based authentication.
- **WebRTC Connection:** Establish a WebRTC PeerConnection and DataChannel.
- **JSONâ€‘RPC Messaging:** Send JSONâ€‘RPC calls over the DataChannel for various commands.
- **Keyboard Input:** Functions for sending keyboard events including text, control combinations (Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-X, etc.), and special keys (Return, Windows key, etc.).
- **Mouse Control:** Functions for absolute mouse movement, clicks (left, right, middle), double-click, and click-and-drag actions.
- **Notification Handling:** Receive notifications (e.g. videoInputState) and update internal state (such as screen resolution).
- **Configurable:** Easily configure connection parameters (IP, port, API endpoint, and password) using environment variables. For a simple parameter bag, use the tuple-struct `JetKvmParams`.

## Installation

Add this crate as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
jetkvm_control = "0.1.0"  # or use a git dependency / local path during development
```

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/davehorner/jetkvm_control.git
   cd jetkvm_control
    ```
2. **Configure Your Settings**

    Before running the project, update your configuration settings. The project reads its configuration from either a config.toml file or environment variables. For example, create a config.toml with your settings:
      ```toml
      host = "host/ip"
      password = "your_password_here"
      port = "80"
      api = "/webrtc/session"
      ```
3. **Running the Project**
    After setting up your configuration, you can build and run the project with Cargo:
     ```bash
     cargo run
     ```

    This will compile the project and start the demo application which:
  
        - Connects to the JetKVM service,
        - Opens a WebRTC DataChannel,
        - Sends RPC calls to perform actions (e.g., keyboard events, mouse clicks).

## WebRTC and SRTP Patching

JetKVM **relies heavily on WebRTC** for real-time communication, but we encountered several issues that required **custom patches** to the WebRTC Rust implementation. Below is an overview of the changes:

### ðŸ”‘ **SRTP Key Length Fix**
- Initially, **SRTP key derivation** failed due to an incorrect **key length mismatch** (`expected 16, got 32`).
- We modified WebRTCâ€™s **SRTP protection profile** to enforce **AES128CM_HMAC_SHA1_80**, ensuring **16-byte key compatibility**.
- The Cargo.toml points to the patched https://github.com/davehorner/webrtc/tree/jetkvm_16_bit_patch

## Note
  - Password-based authentication is functional.
  - Cloud integration and ICE/STUN support are not implemented yet.
  - Password-less authentication has not been tested.
