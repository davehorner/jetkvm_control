# jetkvm_control

**jetkvm_control** is a Rust library and client for interacting with JetKVM devices using WebRTC and JSON‚ÄëRPC. It provides functionality to authenticate with a JetKVM server, set up a WebRTC PeerConnection with a DataChannel, and send various input events (keyboard and mouse) as well as receive notifications (such as screen resolution updates) from the device.

## Features

- **HTTP Authentication:** Log in to a JetKVM server with cookie-based authentication.
- **WebRTC Connection:** Establish a WebRTC PeerConnection and DataChannel.
- **JSON‚ÄëRPC Messaging:** Send JSON‚ÄëRPC calls over the DataChannel for various commands.
- **Keyboard Input:** Functions for sending keyboard events including text, control combinations (Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-X, etc.), and special keys (Return, Windows key, etc.).
- **Mouse Control:** Functions for absolute mouse movement, clicks (left, right, middle), double-click, and click-and-drag actions.
- **Notification Handling:** Receive notifications (e.g. videoInputState) and update internal state (such as screen resolution).
- **Configurable:** Easily configure connection parameters (IP, port, API endpoint, and password) using environment variables. For a simple parameter bag, use the tuple-struct `JetKvmParams`.

## Installation

Add this crate as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
jetkvm_control = "0.1.0"  # or use a git dependency / local path during development
```

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/davehorner/jetkvm_control.git
   cd jetkvm_control
    ```
2. **Configure Your Settings**

    Before running the project, update your configuration settings. The project reads its configuration from either a config.toml file or environment variables. For example, create a config.toml with your settings:
      ```toml
      host = "host/ip"
      password = "your_password_here"
      port = "80"
      api = "/webrtc/session"
      ```

    You can also override these values via the command-line. For example:
    ```
    cargo run -- --host 192.168.1.100 --port 8080
    ```

3. **Running the Project**
    After setting up your configuration, you can build and run the project with Cargo:
     ```bash
     cargo run
     ```

    This will compile the project and start the demo application which:
  
        - Connects to the JetKVM service,
        - Opens a WebRTC DataChannel,
        - Sends RPC calls to perform actions (e.g., keyboard events, mouse clicks).

## What's the cmdline client look like

Right now the client doesn't do anything put ping and display some additional debug.

```
A control client for JetKVM over WebRTC.

Usage: jetkvm_control [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -H, --host <HOST>          The host address to connect to
  -p, --port <PORT>          The port number to use
  -a, --api <API>            The API endpoint
  -P, --password <PASSWORD>  The password for authentication
  -h, --help                 Print help
  -V, --version              Print version
```

## What's the code look like

   ```rust
    let config = JetKvmConfig::load()?;
    let mut client = JetKvmRpcClient::new(config);

    if let Err(err) = client.connect().await {
        error!("Failed to connect to RPC server: {:?}", err);
        std::process::exit(1);
    }
    // open notepad and say Hello World, copy and paste.
    send_windows_key(&client).await.ok();
    sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
    rpc_sendtext(&client, "notepad").await.ok();
    sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
    send_return(&client).await.ok();
    sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
    rpc_sendtext(&client, "Hello World").await.ok();
    sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
    send_ctrl_a(&client).await.ok();
    sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
    send_ctrl_x(&client).await.ok();
    sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
    send_ctrl_v(&client).await.ok();
    sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
    send_return(&client).await.ok();
    sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
    send_ctrl_v(&client).await.ok();
   ```

## **Configuration Loading Precedence**
The configuration file (`config.toml`) is loaded based on the following priority order:

### **üìå Priority Order**
| Priority | macOS/Linux                  | Windows                                  |
|----------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ **(Highest)** | `config.toml` (Current Directory) | `config.toml` (Current Directory) |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | `${CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR}/config.toml` | `${CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR}/config.toml` |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ **(System-Wide)** | `/etc/jetkvm_control/config.toml` | `%APPDATA%\jetkvm_control\config.toml` |

### **üìç How Configuration is Resolved**
- **Current Directory (`config.toml`)** ‚Äì Preferred for local development.
- **Cargo Project Root (`CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR/config.toml`)** ‚Äì Used when running inside a Rust project.
- **System-Wide Location (`/etc/jetkvm_control/config.toml` or `%APPDATA%\jetkvm_control\config.toml`)** ‚Äì Used when no local config is found.

If no configuration file is found, the program exits with an error message.


## WebRTC and SRTP Patching

JetKVM **relies heavily on WebRTC** for real-time communication, but we encountered several issues that required **custom patches** to the WebRTC Rust implementation. Below is an overview of the changes:

### üîë **SRTP Key Length Fix**
- Initially, **SRTP key derivation** failed due to an incorrect **key length mismatch** (`expected 16, got 32`).
- We modified WebRTC‚Äôs **SRTP protection profile** to enforce **AES128CM_HMAC_SHA1_80**, ensuring **16-byte key compatibility**.
- The Cargo.toml points to the patched https://github.com/davehorner/webrtc/tree/jetkvm_16_bit_patch

## Note
  - Password-based authentication is functional.
  - Cloud integration and ICE/STUN support are not implemented yet.
  - Password-less authentication has not been tested.
